# About

Responsive web design is an approach to web development that ensures a website's layout and content adapt to look good and function well on any device, from a large desktop monitor to a small mobile phone. It uses flexible grids, responsive images, and CSS media queries to create a single, dynamic website that provides an optimal user experience across different screen sizes and orientations.
